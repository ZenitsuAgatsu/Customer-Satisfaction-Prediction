# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction using historical support ticket data. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify customers as satisfied or unsatisfied based on various features from support interactions.

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
5. Model Evaluation (Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Output
Best performing model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
